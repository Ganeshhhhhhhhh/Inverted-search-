# Inverted-search-
An Inverted Search project involves creating a program that indexes a set of documents to enable efficient search queries. This project uses a hash table to store the index, allowing for quick lookups of words and their occurrences in the documents. The project includes functions for saving, displaying, searching, and updating the indexed data.
Key Features
Document Indexing:

Read multiple text documents.
Parse and tokenize the documents into words.
Store each word and its document occurrences in a hash table.

Search Queries:

Allow users to input search queries.
Retrieve and display the documents containing the queried words.

Hash Table Implementation:

Implement a hash table for efficient storage and retrieval.
Handle collisions using techniques like chaining.

Functional Operations:

Save: Save the indexed data to a file.
Display: Display the indexed data.
Search: Search for words and retrieve associated documents.
Update: Update the index with new documents or words.
