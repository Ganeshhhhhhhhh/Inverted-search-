# Inverted-search-
An Inverted Search project involves creating a program that indexes a set of documents to enable efficient search queries. This project uses a hash table to store the index, allowing for quick lookups of words and their occurrences in the documents. The project includes functions for saving, displaying, searching, and updating the indexed data.
